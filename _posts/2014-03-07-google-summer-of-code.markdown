Octave was selected as a [mentoring organization][1] for the
[Google Summer of Code][2] program for 2014.
We have participated in the past as part of the [GNU Project][3]
but this is the first year that we have been a mentoring organization.

Interested students who meet the [requirements][4] listed on the GSoC
web site are encouraged to apply (see the Students and Eligibility section).
Please also note the [guidelines for Octave][5].
