We always need more help improving Octave
and there are many ways you can contribute.
You can help by fixing bugs,
developing new features,
writing [Octave Forge packages]({{ site.sourceforge_url }}),
answering questions in Discourse,
helping to improve the web pages.
If you are wondering what to work on,
we have a standard answer:
**What would you like to work on?**

For some inspiration,
we do maintain a [list of possible projects]({{ site.wiki_url }}/Projects)
and a [Developer FAQ]({{ site.wiki_url }}/Developer_FAQ) on the Octave Wiki.

If know what to contribute,
discuss your ideas with us on [Discourse]({{ site.discourse_url }})
("maintainers" category) or on our IRC
[Freenode `{{ site.irc_channel }}` channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/#octave).


### Using the Development Sources

The latest development sources of GNU Octave are available via
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) (hg).
The primary repository address is
[https://www.octave.org/hg/octave](https://www.octave.org/hg/octave),
which currently redirects to
[https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave).
You obtain the latest development version of Octave sources with the following
command:

{% highlight text %}
hg clone https://www.octave.org/hg/octave
{% endhighlight %}

The [Developer FAQ]({{ site.wiki_url }}/Developer_FAQ) on the Octave Wiki
contains more detailed and recent information about Octave development.
